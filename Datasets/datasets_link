The following link sends you to the datasets in my drive

The datasets noise_10, noise_25, noise_50 are designed for testing.
They are datasets with image pairs (clean,noise) with fixed noise 10,25,50 depending on the folder

The folder noise_0_to_50 is the training dataset I used for training.
It was corrupted with noise [0,50] of standard deviation.

Remember this is the training kaggle dataset:
Source https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data

A total of 4400 images of each standard deviation were created with my python program
multipleImageNoiseCreator.py in the Utils folder.

You may use it to create your own training dataset.
